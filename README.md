[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cormas/Booklet-CORMAS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cormas/Booklet-CORMAS)

## Install pillar on our computer
Most of the information about pillar are available [here](https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/EnterprisePharoBook/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/book-result/PillarChap/Pillar.pdf). But we provide there a quick strater quite in order to compile in PDF/html the book source code.

### Install for Linux users
Those command line will download a pharo distribution made for pillar.

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pillar-markup/pillar/master/download.sh
    chmod +x download.sh
    ./download.sh

## Compilation from sources

In order to build a human reading file, you need to compile the source file :

    ./pillar export --to=html book.pillar

It creates an `output.html.json` file note yet readable by humans.

    ./mustache --data=output.html.json --template=support/templates/html.mustache > myfile.html

Et voil√† !
