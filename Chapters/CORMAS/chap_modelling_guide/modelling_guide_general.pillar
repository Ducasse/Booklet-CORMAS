!!!The UI of Cormas

The main window of Cormas-UI can be open from the world contextual menu (fig. *@openCormasUI*).
+Open Cormas-UI>file://figures/openCormasUI.png|label=openCormasUI+

To open a model which already exists in your current image select File>Open>Local image, then choose one of the available models

The model is loaded as the current Cormas project and the simulation window appears (fig. *@simulationWindow*).
+Open Cormas-UI>file://figures/simulationWindow.png|label=simulationWindow+

Simulation window > Button 1 : Define a scenario and initialize the simulation 
Simulation window > Button 2 : Run one step (the simulation needs to be initialized first)
Simulation window > Button 3 : Run the simulation until the final step (the simulation needs to be initialized first)
Simulation window > Field A : Current time step of the simulation (cannot be edited)
Simulation window > Field B : Final step of the simulation (can be edited by the user)

!!!! Launch a simulation and follow it run using the probes chart window
1/ Define a scenario and initialize the simulation
Click the Initiliaze button (n°1 in fig. *@simulationWindow*).

The scenario window opens (fig. *@defineScenarioWin).
+Open Cormas-UI>file://figures/defineScenarioWin.png|label=defineScenarioWin+

A scenario is composed of an initialization method and a control method. The initialization method specifies the state of environmnent and the entities network at the begining of the simulation (at step 0). The control method specifies the behaviour of the entities and each step and the order in which they will be executed.

Choose a init method 
Choose a control method
Modify the default final step if necessary
Choose some probes that you want to record and view.
  * The defaultInit, defaultControl, defaultFinalStep and defaultProbes are selected when the window opens. Their values  can be defined by selectors at the CormasModel class side.
Click Apply

The simulation is now initialize. The current time step is zero. The simulation can be run.

Launch the simulation either using 'Step by step' button (n°2 in fig. *@simulationWindow*') or by using the run button (n°3 in fig. *@simulationWindow*').

To open the probes chart window select 'Visualization>Probes' from Cormas-UI main window. 

The chart window is updated at each step and reset when the simulation is re-initialized.
